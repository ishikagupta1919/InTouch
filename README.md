# InTouch - Team CodeForSupport
An interactive and simple training application that, using simple commands, will
help the user to learn and get accustomed to the utilities of any smart phone. Upon prompting a
question, let's say "How to open the camera?", the application will provide step by step guidance
with the help of very user friendly animations and appropriate interface designs, to do the job.
Along with the textual guidance, we plan to integrate it with google assistant for text to speech
translation of the same.
